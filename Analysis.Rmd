```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Executive Summary:
In this anaylsis I will answer the question:

Do transmission type (automatic vs. manual) have a positive effect on mpg (mile pr. gallon), and if so, how much?

The short answer to this question, and based on the following, is "yes" - given the provided dataset.
The second half of the question; "how much" is a bit more difficult to answer as several variables can cause thos effect, not transmission alone. But given the dataset at hand, we will try to answer this a precise as possible.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
